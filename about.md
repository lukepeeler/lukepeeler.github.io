I'm a recent graduate of The University of Chicago and an avid lover of programming and all its possibilities. I'm currently working in Chicago's Loop for a proprietary trading firm and learning about financial markets, low-latency trading, and all the technologies that support them. 

I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate on new projects, particularly at the intersection of public and social policy and computer science. Feel free to contact me using the information below!
